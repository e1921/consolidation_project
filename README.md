This Python program simulates a two-player card game using a 48-card deck (no Kings). Players take turns playing cards and must follow the lead suit if possible. Points are scored each round based on who wins the trick. The game includes special rules such as dealing additional cards mid-game, early game end conditions, and a “shoot the moon” scoring rule. The player with the most points at the end wins.

Requirements:
Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download it from python.org.
A code editor or terminal (like VSCode).

Steps to run it:
Save the provided code into a consolidationproject.py file
Open your command line interface (Anaconda Powershell Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).
Navigate to the directory where you saved consolidationproject.py using the cd command. For example: cd path/to/your/file
Run the program by typing: python consolidationproject.py
Follow instructions carefully and enter card numbers as asked. Enjoy the game!
